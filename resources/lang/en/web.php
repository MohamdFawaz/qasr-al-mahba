Despite this mineral wealth, commercial mining until recently has played a relatively minor role in the development of the country\'s economy due, among other reasons, to incomplete geological data, an undeveloped legal and overall business environment, and, perhaps most importantly, a lack of internal and external financial resources necessary to boost the sector.
However, exploration work carried out by the Geological Survey and private entities during the last 20 years has led to the discovery of important deposits of heavy mineral beach sands, coal, gold, tantalum-niobium and other rare metals, graphite, black granite and other dimension stones, gemstones, phosphates as well as many other metallic and non-metallic minerals. Several of these deposits are now being mined or are in development.
